# Gaming PC

## Overview

We are looking to build a 4k multi-boot gaming machine that will still be a good rig for a long time. We can't expect to upgrade the CPU very far later on if at all, but we won't be CPU bottlenecked, and we can be aim to be ready to put in an RTX 5070 or 5080 card 2+ years from now, and not need any other changes.

Generally our parts will correspond with the Exceptional or Enthusiast tiers on Logical Increments, but of course that won't be our only source of info.

https://www.logicalincrements.com/

The 16 tiers are Destitute, Poor, Minimum, Entry, Modest, Fair, Good, Very Good, Great, Superb, Excellent, Outstanding, Exceptional, Enthusiast, Extremist, and Monstrous. 

We already have a 4070 Ti GPU and can go for a much larger primary NVME drive, significantly more RAM, better cooling, and more power supply headroom vs. Logical Increments builds at same budget.

## Accessories and Peripherals

### Monitor

If a new monitor is needed get the Gigabyte M32U or M28U

https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16824012040

These support 144Hz variable refresh rate at 4k and have good brightness, pixel response time, and color accuracy.

The built in KVM will allow the same monitor, keyboard, and mouse to be used for a laptop or portable device when needed, without fiddling with cables or buying a separate rare expensive KVM that supports the full resolution and refresh rate capabilities.

### Additional storage (SATA)

Enterprise SATA drives with a 5 year warranty - either Seagate Exos, Western Digital Gold, or Western Digital Ultrastar (formerly HGST Ultrastar)

Seagate 18TB Exos X18 7200 RPM SATA 6Gb/s 256MB Cache 3.5-Inch Enterprise Hard Drive HDD (ST18000NM000J)

https://www.newegg.com/seagate-exos-x18-st18000nm000j-18tb/p/1B4-00VK-00616

### Keyboard

Consider a Logitech G610 or Corsair K55

### Mouse

Razer, Corsair, or Logitech

Maybe a Logitech G PRO Hero Wired Gaming Mouse

### Mouse Pad or Desk Pad

Probably get a SteelSeries QcK.

A Corsair mouse pad would also be reasonable.

Alternatively, the LTT Deskpad is just the right thickness and is available in a variety of sizes. Tidy look, mouse works great anywhere on the desk.

# Components

### CPU

Intel i7-13700K

For gaming we want best single thread performance, and enough (performance) cores.

We could spend 50% more and get maybe 6% more single thread performance with an i9-13900K, but the i7 has the same number of performance cores at a similar clock speed, and the i9 is really about having additioanl efficiency cores.

### CPU Cooler

Probably an AIO, but only if it will get us better temps than a Noctua air cooler.

Look for quiet, good temps, good reviews. Open to different brands.

### Thermal Compound

Used to use Arctic Silver 5, but today we like Arctic MX-4.

### Motherboard

We'll get a popular Z790 chipset motherboard from a reputable brand with a 4+ rating on newegg. Reputable brands today are Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI. I don't believe in ASRock, EVGA, and NZXT today, and definitely not smaller brands.

Looking for DDR5 memory slots, at least 3 PCIe 4.0 (or 5.0) M.2 2280 slots, Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5G ethernet, and at least 3 PCI-e slots overall.

The MSI MAG Z790 TOMAHAWK has good reviews and is the current best selling Intel board. Has great I/O, 4 M.2 slots, 7 SATA connectors, and some other nice to haves.

### RAM

RAM selection can be a touch complicated.

Going with G.SKILL Ripjaws S5 Series 96GB (2 x 48GB) 288-Pin PC RAM DDR5 6400 (PC5 51200) Desktop Memory Model F5-6400J3239F48GX2-RS5K

https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-96gb/p/N82E16820374499

### SSD

A popular 4TB PCI 4.0 or 5.0 NVME SSD with a 5 year warranty and good reviews. Open to any brand if the reviews are good.

MSI seems to have entered this market at some point and currently looking good. 

https://www.newegg.com/msi-1tb-m461/p/N82E16820140039

Will get an additional 1TB 4.0 or 5.0 NVME SSD so we can make a nice utility partition on it with a partition editor. Not critical, but nice to have for a multi-boot system where we may want to reallocate storage between operating systems.

### Case

Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 Full Tower

https://www.newegg.com/black-phanteks-enthoo-pro-2-atx-full-tower/p/N82E16811854099

By their own description:
- a future-proof full tower 
- extreme versatility and exceptional airflow
- In every aspect built for the pros and enthusiasts
- Spacious interior that supports the most high-end configurations for a modern workstation

The reviews concur, and its a popular option.

Lots of options for mounting storage, fans, and radiators.

### Case Fans

Plenty of <strong><em>quiet</em></strong>, quality 120mm and/or 140mm fans from a good brand such as Noctua or "be quiet!"

Probably we will top mount our AIO radiator, fill out the front and back of our case Enthoo case, and leave the bottom without fans.

## Accessories and Peripherals

### Monitor

If a new monitor is needed get the Gigabyte M32U or M28U

### Additional storage (SATA)

Enterprise SATA drives with a 5 year warranty - either Seagate Exos, Western Digital Gold, or Western Digital Ultrastar (formerly HGST Ultrastar)

Seagate 18TB Exos X18 7200 RPM SATA 6Gb/s 256MB Cache 3.5-Inch Enterprise Hard Drive HDD (ST18000NM000J)

### CPU

Intel i7-13700K

For gaming we want best single thread performance, and enough (performance) cores.

We could spend 50% more and get maybe 6% more single thread performance with an i9-13900K, but the i7 has the same number of performance cores at a similar clock speed, and the i9 is really about having additioanl efficiency cores.

### CPU Cooler

Probably an AIO, but only if it will get us better temps than a Noctua air cooler.

Look for quiet, good temps, good reviews. Open to different brands.

### Thermal Compound

Used to use Arctic Silver 5, but today we like Arctic MX-4.

### Motherboard

We'll get a popular Z790 chipset motherboard from a reputable brand with a 4+ rating on newegg. Reputable brands today are Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI. I don't believe in ASRock, EVGA, and NZXT today, and definitely not smaller brands.

Looking for DDR5 memory slots, at least 3 PCIe 4.0 (or 5.0) M.2 2280 slots, Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5G ethernet, and at least 3 PCI-e slots overall.

The MSI MAG Z790 TOMAHAWK has good reviews and is the current best selling Intel board. Has great I/O, 4 M.2 slots, 7 SATA connectors, and some other nice to haves.

### RAM

RAM selection can be a touch complicated.

Going with G.SKILL Ripjaws S5 Series 96GB (2 x 48GB) 288-Pin PC RAM DDR5 6400 (PC5 51200) Desktop Memory Model F5-6400J3239F48GX2-RS5K

### SSD

A popular 4TB PCI 4.0 or 5.0 NVME SSD with a 5 year warranty and good reviews. Open to any brand if the reviews are good.

MSI seems to have entered this market at some point and currently looking good.

Will get an additional 1TB 4.0 or 5.0 NVME SSD so we can make a nice utility partition on it with a partition editor. Not critical, but nice to have for a multi-boot system where we may want to reallocate storage between operating systems.

### Case

Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 Full Tower

https://www.newegg.com/black-phanteks-enthoo-pro-2-atx-full-tower/p/N82E16811854099

By their own description:
- a future-proof full tower 
- extreme versatility and exceptional airflow
- In every aspect built for the pros and enthusiasts
- Spacious interior that supports the most high-end configurations for a modern workstation

The reviews concur, and its a popular option.

Lots of options for mounting storage, fans, and radiators.

### Case Fans

Plenty of <strong><em>quiet</em></strong>, quality 120mm and/or 140mm fans from a good brand such as Noctua or "be quiet!"

Probably we will top mount our AIO radiator, fill out the front and back of our case Enthoo case, and leave the bottom without fans.
